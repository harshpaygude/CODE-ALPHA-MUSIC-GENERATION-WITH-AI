# Music Generation with AI

Create an AI-powered music generation system capable of composing original music.
Utilize deep learning techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate music sequences.

- The art of music is timeless. It is created through note harmonization and instrument collaborationâ€”many instruments are used in its composition. Thus, deep neural network-based music production is closely linked to these musical characteristics. Numerous models have been put forth as far to produce music. A few of them are built using the architecture of variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, or recurrent neural networks.
